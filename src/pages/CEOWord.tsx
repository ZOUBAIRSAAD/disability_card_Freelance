                  "Many people live with invisible disabilities conditions like chronic pain, mental health challenges, and neurological disorders that aren’t immediately noticeable but significantly affect everyday life. Despite being hidden, these disabilities are just as impactful and deserving of support as any visible condition. Those who face these challenges often deal with ongoing physical, emotional, and mental strain while receiving little recognition or understanding in public settings, workplaces, or when accessing services."

This type of identification can help ensure that individuals are treated with the same level of care, accommodation, and respect as those with visible impairments. It can also promote greater awareness and bridge the gap in support systems, encouraging a more inclusive and empathetic society."
